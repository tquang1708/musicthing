## WIP senior project - Musicthing

A self-hosted music streaming service built on Rust, Postgres and React. Work in progress.

### Installation

Make sure Rust, Postgress and Node are installed. Afterwards, simply running the `run.sh` script should set the backend up to run on port 8000 and the frontend on 3000, with these being the default ports.
